# define the IMU types to probe. You can list more IMUs than you
# actually have. The syntax for IMU declarations is:
#  IMU DriverName DeviceDeclarations Arguments
# the DriverName is the C++ name of the driver in AP_InertialSensor
# the DeviceDeclarations are either SPI or I2C
# for SPI the format is SPI:devicename where devicename comes from the
# SPIDEV table above
# for I2C the format is I2C:BusNum:BusAddr7bit, for example I2C:0:0x1e

IMU Invensense SPI:mpu6000 ROTATION_ROLL_180

# define the barometers to probe with BARO lines. These follow the
# same format as IMU lines
BARO MS5611 SPI:ms5611
BARO MS5607 SPI:ms5607

# probe for mag.
# note that the number of arguments and meanings for compass driver
# declarations is driver dependent. For example, the HMC5843 driver takes two
# arguments, the first for whether the compass is external and the
# second the orientation. The LSM303D driver doesn't take any arguments
# Newer 2.4.8 uses a single IST8310
